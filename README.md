This password generator will create a random password between 8 and 128 characters, as selected by the user, and runs once the user selects the "Generate Password" button.

The password will be comprised by character sets selected by the user and then randomly selected by the application.

User will be alerted if their password is too short, too long or if they did not select at least one of the four character sets.

Additionally, the user will be able to easily copy the generated password to their clipboard to paste as needed.
